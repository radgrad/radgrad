This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more semesters where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](../courses/ics499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

You will generally want to ask them to update your historical data from your STAR data after each semester.\n\nFor current and future semesters, you can freely add and delete courses and opportunities according to your preferences.

You are eligible to select any degree plan available during the year you declare yourself as an ICS major, and you can switch to any future degree plan if you prefer. \n\nOnce you have selected an Academic Plan, RadGrad will indicate which requirements you have and have not satisfied in your degree plan: requirements you have satisfied are listed in green, and those you have not are listed in red.\n\nIn the sample Academic Plan image, you can see that the student has satisfied all the requirements except for one 400-level course, since it is presented in red.\n\n<div class=\"ui clearing hidden divider\"></div>\n\n#### Recommendations & Warnings\n\n<img class=\"ui medium left floated image\" src=\"/images/help/degree-planner-recommendations-warnings.png\">\n\nRadGrad can offer personalized recommendations for courses and opportunities based upon your desired degree, your interests, and your career goals. \n\nIt will also flag problems with your degree plan, such as adding a course without the appropriate prerequisite.\n\n<div class=\"ui hidden clearing divider\"></div>"

          "text": "Many students think the only important measure of academic success is their GPA. Sadly, whether you're hoping to go to graduate school or just get an interesting, high paying job after graduation, a good GPA is no longer enough for you to stand out from the crowd.\n\nIn today's competitive market, employers and graduate schools are looking for evidence that you are *competent* with essential skills, that you can create *innovative* solutions to problems, and that you have some *experience* with the professional world outside of the university setting.\n\nRadGrad provides ICE as a way for you to measure your progress toward a truly well-rounded education that goes beyond the GPA. For each course and opportunity you participate in, you gain a certain number of ICE points.  Your goal, should you decide to accept it, is to achieve 100 points in all three categories by the time you graduate. \n\nSo just exactly how do you obtain these points?\n\n**Innovation**: You earn innovation points by completing opportunities that involve \"innovation\", such as research projects, hackathons, or other activities producing new insights or technologies. \n\n**Competency**: You earn competency points by completing classes.  The number of competency points depends upon your grade: you get 10 points for any kind of A, 6 points for any kind of B, and no points for a C or below. \n\n**Experience**: You earn experience points by completing opportunities that provide \"real world experience\", such as internships or business plan competitions.\n\n#### The ICE Circle, explained\n\n<img style=\"padding-left: 10px\" class=\"ui small left floated image\" src=\"/images/help/ice-circle.png\">\n\nYour current ICE status is displayed graphically with a circle that appears in your navigation bar at the top of each RadGrad page, and also in annotated form on this page.   The circle indicates several things:\n\nFirst, your current number of *verified* points for this ICE measure. This appears as a number in the center of the circle.  It is also represented by the darkly colored portion of the circle. In this example, the student has 5 verified Innovation points, which appears as a number in the center of the circle and with 5% of the circle colored with a dark green line.\n\nSecond, your current number of *unverified* points for this ICE measure.  This appears as the lightly colored portion of the circle. In this example, the student has 90 unverified innovation points, which typically indicates the points she will receive for opportunities she has planned to participate at some future date in her degree program. So, 90% of the circle is colored with a light green line.\n\nThird, whether or not you have planned enough courses or opportunities to achieve 100 points for this ICE measure.  If any portion of the circle is light grey, that indicates that you have not yet planned enough courses or opportunities. In this example, the student has only added enough opportunities to her degree plan to achieve 95 Innovation points. So, 5% of the circle is colored with a light grey line.\n\n#### Verification\n\nThe RadGrad ICE score would not be meaningful if the points do not accurately represent the actual degree program experience. Therefore, all ICE points must be verified in order to count.  Otherwise, someone could get competency points for courses they didn't take, or experience points for internships they didn't actually do.\n\nTo verify your coursework, visit an ICS advisor after each semester to ask them to upload your current STAR data to RadGrad.  You will receive verified competency points for each course in your STAR data that appears in RadGrad. \n\nOpportunities are verified in many different ways.  Each opportunity description lists the mechanism for verification. For example, for some opportunities it may be as simple as taking a selfie with the organizer and then showing that picture to an ICS advisor or faculty member."

Students can pick your research project for multiple semesters and earn innovation points for each semester.\n\n4.

For example, say a student wants to get a B.S. in Computer Science, and they declare our major in 2016.  Then, they can choose the B.S. in Computer Science academic plan from 2015 (since that was the one currently in effect when they declared their major).

For example, \"B.A. in Computer Science\" or \"B.S. in Computer Sciences/Security Sciences\" are degree programs.\n\n* An \"academic plan\" is the set of departmental course requirements that must be fulfilled in order to complete a degree program. Departments can change the requirements once a year, and so academic plans have a year associated with them that indicates the year that they became the default requirements for their associated degree program.\n\nOnce students declare our major, they can choose the current academic plan associated with a degree program, or any future update to the academic plan. For example, say a student wants to get a B.S. in Computer Science, and they declare our major in 2016. Then, they can choose the B.S. in Computer Science academic plan from 2015 (since that was the one currently in effect when they declared their major). They can also choose any future updated version of the academic plan, such as the B.S. in Computer Science from 2017.\n\nThis page lists all of the currently defined academic plans.

When students pick an opportunity, they associate it with a specific semester (Fall, Spring, Summer).\n\nFor mentors, opportunities provide a mechanism for you to advertise internships in your company to students for Fall, Spring, or Summer. Advertising your internships as opportunities has the following advantages to you:\n\n1. By specifying one or more \"interests\" (i.e. disciplinary areas) associated with your internship opportunity, RadGrad can recommend your project to students who have also specified those interest areas.\n\n2. Because students gain ICE points for completing opportunities, and because we recommend you award the maximum number of Experience points (25) for participating in a full-time summer internship, students who wish to achieve the higher levels in RadGrad will almost certainly need to participate in an internship for at least one semester.\n\n3. Students can pick your internship for multiple semesters and gain opportunity points for each semester.\n\n4. Finally, you might be able to arrange for the student to enroll in an independent study course with a faculty member in addition to this opportunity. That gives the student the ability to \"double dip\", and gain both Innovation and Experience points for the same work.\n\nThis page shows currently defined opportunities, but does not allow you to define a new one.  If you wish to define a new RadGrad opportunity (typically for an internship at your company), then contact a RadGrad administrator for assistance."

Originally specified in 1958, Lisp is the second-oldest high-level programming language in widespread use today; only Fortran is older (by one year). Lisp was originally created as a practical mathematical notation for computer programs, influenced by the notation of Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It quickly became the favored programming language for artificial intelligence (AI) research. As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, and the self-hosting compiler.

Machine learning explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make predictions on data. Such algorithms operate by building a model from example inputs in order to make data-driven predictions or decisions expressed as outputs. Machine learning is employed in a range of computing tasks where designing and programming explicit algorithms is infeasible. Example applications include spam filtering, optical character recognition (OCR), search engines, and computer vision. [Learn more here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)",

In some cases parallelism is transparent to the programmer, such as in bit-level or instruction-level parallelism, but explicitly parallel algorithms, particularly those that use concurrency, are more difficult to write than sequential ones, because concurrency introduces several new classes of potential software bugs, of which race conditions are the most common. Communication and synchronization between the different subtasks are typically some of the greatest obstacles to getting good parallel program performance.

But rather than the traditional around-the-clock development over a single day or weekend, HACC will offer an extended period for development over one month.\n\nThe kickoff event will include team formation, foundational training, and workshops. In addition, participants will select from a list of challenges themed around key problems facing the state, and then work over the next several weeks to develop their solutions. The expanded month-long timeframe is meant to encourage sustainable solutions that are appropriately matched with technologies and platforms in use or being considered by the state. \n\n[Learn more here.](http://hacc.hawaii.gov/)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nTake a selfie at this event and submit to this Opportunity's sponsor along with work products as evidence of your participation.",

Topics include circuitry, computer hardware and software, Minecraft ahupuaʻa, and modding. This year we’re also running a series of traveling workshops teaching javascript and xcode in different communities around Oʻahu and exposing more students to coding.\n\nWe target middle school kids because they’re at an age where they’re open and ready for learning coding basics, but we will eventually provide edtech opportunities throughout the course of education. The metaphor we use is the idea of a tech ʻauwai–a channel of tech knowledge that kids can flow along through school, interacting with and enriching their communities along the way.\n\n[Learn more here.](http://www.purplemaia.org/)\n\n#### Verification criteria\nAt the conclusion of the internship, request that this Opportunity's sponsor login to RadGrad to verify your participation.

The projects weren't hard for beginner programmers and were interesting to get them to have more fun with programming. The only downside was that the class didn't fully prepare you for ICS 211 where the fun little projects became assignments focused on the next stage of programming. There isn't much new students can do in terms of preparing for ICS 211 from ICS 111 since it is based on what you learn, but the things that you do learn may prove useful.",

Although it made it easy to get a good grade in the course, it negatively impacted my ability to fully understand the fundamental concepts taught in ICS 111. I entered the C.S. program at UH Manoa with no prior experience in programming and ICS 111 did not provide the necessary foundation for a struggling student, like me, who never programmed anything before. However, I am glad that the course has changed since then and implemented homework assignments and quizzes. As an assistant TA for the course in Fall 2016, the assignments and quizzes proved to be extremely helpful in guiding the students in understanding fundamental programming concepts. In addition, the graphics-oriented style of teaching helped them (and myself when I took the course) to be able to visualize the concepts. This seemed to be more effective as opposed to looking at output on the console with no graphics to give hints on how your code executed. For any students that take this course in the future, I highly encourage them to take advantage of the open lab hours and the TA's office hours. It's their job to help you and chances are that they were in your shoes not too long ago. They won't make any negative judgement about you unless you didn't start the homework yet...",

          "comments": "ICS 111 was my first Computer Science and programming class. It was a interesting class and I enjoyed it. The projects in the class utilized EZ, a Java graphics library provided by the professor to make programming fun and interactive. This was definitely one of the strengths in the class because the students of this class can visually see how programming concepts such as arrays and inheritance can be applied to. Using a graphics-based approach was definitely something that makes programming more appealing to those who are just trying ICS out for the first time-- and those who initially joined ICS to become video game developers. Although making graphics move around through Java was more interesting than just looking at black and white text, I feel that it could also be one of the weaknesses in this course as well. The more time spent on learning how to use EZ at the beginning meant less time learning how to catch on the basics of programming such as functions and classes. I felt that it took me two months or so to catch onto these things when I took the class. My main advice to future students is that although this class is super fun it is important to learn and understand what they are doing. It's nice to know that \"oh this method makes a picture move\" but understanding the return types and what is happening in the background is important too.",

          "comments": "My course that was taught by a KCC professor, but it was held at UH, and was somewhat decent because she went by the book on the basics of ICS, both theory and code. This course was very good in terms of introducing students to ICS because it went over the theory of computing, taught how to properly trace, and was really strict on code style. However, the projects done were lack luster and the pacing of the actual course could have been much faster. My course had very simple projects such as creating a program to calculate the area/volume of a sphere then display it out on console in \"pretty print.\" The most complex project done was to make an e-shop interface using JAVA FX which would add items to the cart and calculate the total. However, this was the very last project we had to do. This was possibly the funnest project out of the bunch and made me really enjoy the class, but I wanted more of these fun projects rather than the simple calculate. From what I understand, the course taught by another professor does what I suggest right now but does not go over over-arching themes in ICS/theory of computation. I think that tracing and understand how computers work are an integral part in an introductory course to ICS. As for workload, the main issue with students when they first enter the course is that they work on their code at the very last minute. Future courses in the ICS department will not give you this same luxury and it is advised to get in the habit of doing work earlier.",

          "comments": "ICS 111, taught by Jason Leigh, was a great course to begin the ICS journey here at UH Manoa.  The class was big, but the smaller lab classes really made the class interactive.  As a transfer student, I already took beginner CS classes at another university, so a lot of the topics were review.  However, I was challenged by the projects and homework assignments given in the course.  The TA for our lab section was helpful and accessible.  The one weakness of the class that I can think of is that all of the assignments except for the last final project was individual work.  That made it difficult to work with others at the end of the semester, since most of the work had to be done individually prior to the final project.  Other than that, I thought the class was challenging and even though it wasn't my first ICS class, I still learned a lot.  A tip for future students would be to utilize the TA.  They are there to help and want you to do well in the class.",

The labs definitely gave me a lot of much needed time to ask the TA questions and work on my code. Learning the material in lecture, then reinforcing it during labs, was a big strength for this class. One thing I found to be a weakness were the practical exams. Coding is best done when one can be comfortable and focused. I felt I wasn't able to produce the best quality of code I could have under the pressure of the given time limit. Since this class sets the foundations for basic coding behavior, many things learned here will be helpful for future ICS classes.",

Just understanding the basic concepts of coding can be tough, but taking a easy approach and doing fun stuff, like making games, made the class very enjoyable and easy to learn from.  The cons.  I felt that there were some core concepts missed in ICS 111.  When I went on to 211 I struggled a bit in the beginning because I had to relearn how to do some basic concepts E.G. ,\"For loops\", because they were not instilled very effectively.  But overall this class is great for people who have just begun to code and makes some of the more abstract concepts tangible.",

A strength for this course is that Jason Leigh makes the lectures very fun and uses real life examples when teaching code. The lectures made the rules and basics of java very easy to understand. \n\nThe weakness of this course was that there was not enough TA to go around to help the students. I first took this course in the semester Fall 2015 and had a huge lab. Many students barely got any help due to the TA helping out other students. I would see half the students in my lab class just sitting and waiting for help majority of the time. I was one of those students so I ended up getting a B-. Second time I took this class, luckily I had a smaller lab class and was able to get the help I needed. My advice to future students are to practice and start projects early so you can go in for office hours and be the one of the first students in lab asking for help because getting help is very hard to come by when there are a lot of students taking ICS 111.",

Since ICS 111 is an introductory class to computer science, it focus more on the creativity on programming and develop our interest on coding. I think Professor Jason Leigh did a really good job on this course and led our interest to programming. The three projects we designed are all game projects and really fun for his class. However, we did not learn much as coding( we did learn the basis java). For every project we had done, we also need import EZ.java which is a library consisting many useful functions created by the instructor. Such as: if we want to create a window, we do not have to go through all the JFrame things, just simply use initialize(height, width) to create a new window. Anyway, ICS 111 is a fun class and I do recommend taking his class for the future students.",

Some of the strengths of the class was that you had it four days a week. Two days in lecture (where you learn topics and code) and two days in the lab that focuses entirely on applying what you learned in the lecture. What made the labs even better was that they implemented the flipped classroom setting. Another strength was that the homework assignments were just right in terms of difficulty as well as being fun to do. If they were too hard, the student had many opportunities finding help. The only weakness the class had was not introducing us to Java toolkits or other topics like graphical user interfaces.",

New material had some type of connection with past material, which made it relatively easy to understand new concepts. With each additional concept learned, there was supportive practice material that enabled mastery of the concepts. In addition, “challenge” questions were assigned as extra credit, which allowed students to really test if they understood the material. Strengths include clear lectures, which made the material easy to understand as examples that utilized a new concept helped strengthen understanding. Weaknesses include not enough one-on-one time with instructors or with teaching assistants, as there were so many students in the class.

Also there is no textbook, yay our wallets!\nA weakness of this course is that it can give you a sense of false confidence. ICS 111 is like learning how to swim in knee deep water with a personal lifeguard by your side. So when it time to move on to the higher classes you can feel overwhelmed because of how many things you can do with what you learned in ICS 111.\nMy advice to future students is ICS 111 is make sure you do your homework and you understand your homework. ICS 111 is like learning a foreign language. Just because it is an introductory class, doesn't mean you won't have to put in time outside of the class. To some people it comes to them naturally, to others this class can be one of the most challenging class you have ever taken. But don't give up, because once you see the solution to your problem, you will realize that you had the answer, but you forgot a curly bracket.",

Students will find this class to be very easy, if they put the work and time into this class. The most important thing that you can do for yourself in this class is to get a good teacher. Because of how easy the class is the only thing that will hold a student back in it is their interest. If you have a boring teacher you will not be motivated to learn and you will fall farther and farther behind in the class.There are many different ways to find the perfect teacher but in my experience the best ways are to use sites like rate my professor or to use publicly view able cafes.",

The strength I feel would depend if you get a good TA or not, but the recitations were really helpful in better understanding the concepts and asking question on concepts you didn't understand. For future students I would utilize the recitations to better understand concepts and other students outside of class time for help as well.",

          "comments": "ICS 141 is very important when it comes to the theory of coding. The only problem with the course is that not everyone has the ability to digest a math heavy class. ICS 141 taken in conjunction with ICS 111 allows you to somewhat get the application of the things you learn. However, the problems given on homework and exams do not properly illustrate the application of ICS141 to certain individuals. Like when one has students extensively simplify predicates, there should be a call back to actual code where simplifying predicates would greatly save screen space on a file and increase source code legibility. If students are able to further understand the application of the theory behind 141 and where to apply it, then I feel more people will be able to digest the content easily -- I don't think the actual text helped many students understand the applications of the theory.  Personally, I was unable to stay awake during the long lectures because of the time they took place, 6:00, and I ended up watching screen casts for the course by the professor or from another professor in another college. Because of this, I feel that the flipped-class format is really good because not all students are able to properly pay attention and process the information they are being given during long extended time periods. The only two pieces advice I have for students that take this course is to actually put in the time and read/practice/create problems related to the current topic being covered during the week. In addition, make a study group where every contributes to a portion of the notes and people teach/go over the concepts that were covered in the chapter. The sole purpose of study groups should not only be dedicated to doing homework.",

This also incentivized you to do better if you felt you were 'under the curve'. In addition, we were walked through the LaTeX typing system through various tutorials and that was an invaluable skill.\n\nThere were really no weaknesses to the course.

It helped me understand concepts I learned in 211 and 212 much better.  The Cons.   This class is very difficult, especially to people who are not the most advanced in Math.  I find that some of the material is difficult to understand and grasp but when you finally do figure it out, it makes a lot of sense.

Everything is explained in pseudocode and mathematical equations. This is a class of people just starting to learn pseudocode so this made it almost impossible to understand the notes/slides. We did have a website where we could ask questions about homework problems, but it was very difficult to write these mathematical equations and try to understand a very complicating answer online.

I knew a little programming at the time but couldn't relate the math to computer science. There was only one grade for the class and that was the final, so if you fail the final, you fail the class. The materials were very intimidating and sadly the professor didn't make it motivating to learn either. I took advance courses in math before but even then, I had a difficult time understanding discrete math. What happened was I ended up turning in HW that were considered complete or not complete, try to memorize last minute concepts to attempt quizzes without knowing why I got it wrong and settle to just pass the course without fully understanding what was going on. Now I am currently taking 311 (algorithms )and I am in for major catching up as I only skimmed through the fundamentals without applying it to computer science.\nThe only good thing about this class I thought was that yes, this course checks the block for taking discrete math but fail to prepare the students for future ICS courses.",

It isn't like your normal math class you were taught in high school. It is more about problem solving and logical reasoning without the numbers. This class will open your mind, and definitely improve your thinking process (This will be very very very important when trying to write programs in your other ICS classes).\nA weakness of ICS 141 is that as a freshman this will most likely by your hardest class. Not because of the workload, but because it will demand you to think. Not trying to say that you don't know how to think, but lets say this isn't one of those classes where you just drink an energy drink the night before an exam and cram. That won't work here. Another weakness is that the textbook is quite expensive and heavy.\nMy advice to future students is to do every homework question assigned. If you don't get it, make use of your professor and TA's office hours. Even if they explain it the same way they did the first, you will be amazed how much of a difference it makes to hear something a second time. A good way to practice before exams is to do the odd problems that are similar to the homework questions you got wrong or topics where you are still shaky on. Lastly, do not sell back your textbook during buyback week. You will need it for ICS 241.",

A strength of this course is definitely being able to take it right after ICS 111. Near the end of this course when I had a technical interview for an internship, I barely had to study for my interview because ICS 211 gave me a sneak peek of how technical interviews are like and what is tested on them-- Data structures. I ended up getting the internship and if it weren't for my ICS 211 professor preparing me for this, I would have not been where I am today. Being tested on writing code everyday was a great strength of this course because in a real life interview, it is just you and a whiteboard-- No IDE. I can say that one of the weaknesses of this course is that once students realize the basic methods of a data structure like a LinkedList, it becomes easy to just memorize code and forget about it a month later compared to actually understanding it. With that said, my advice for future students is to be diligent when studying for this course because it will shape their ability to perform well on a technical interview.

This format was possibly the most ideal because I was able to work at my own pace and take notes at my own pace. Simply being able to playback the screen cast at whatever speed was possibly the best thing for my learning experience. All the resources were collectively on youtube and I did not have to look any where else in order to find the screencast that I was looking for. In addition, having a daily quiz about writing out code on the actual implementation on the data structures helped solidify how the data structures worked and kept me on my toes in order to maintain a grade. The course schedule, assignments, readings, and screencasts all found on the morea review/course website was incredibly useful in planning how much time I need to invest in order to properly learn topics rather than copy pasting from my brain the code that was from the book/video. The only issue is homework assignments were rather lack luster from time to time because certain homework assignments were simply just implementing the data structure and that was it--or some rather trivial application that did not take much thought. I feel that the screencasts, quizzes, and exercises that were done in and outside of classes were more than enough to understand how to implement a data structure. Therefore, I wanted more assignments that involved using the data structure to solve a given problem, preferably real-world rather than theoretical. Students taking this course should have no problem passing it as long as they take the time to read and understand the concepts that are shown on the website. If students struggle with certain topics, it's best to make a study group and, essentially, teach each other the concepts so that everyone understand the topic to the point where the student is \"fluent\" in said topic.",

One of my favorite thing about taking this class is that it’s structured in a small classroom. It’s hard for me to learn in a big lecture room, because it’s really hard to follow along. Studying in a small classroom help me to pay more attention, since it’s easier to ask questions, and I also feel like the professor is paying attention to me, so it keep me alerted. Second thing I like about this class is that we come to class only to take a quiz and to ask questions, and we were required to do take the lecture at home. I personally prefer self-studying, since I can follow my own pace, and I also like practicing while studying. I think I’m absorbing a lot more information in this way, since when practicing, I’m constantly getting more and more questions, by answering question of my own, I’m strengthening my memory. I think this is a good course in general, but one weakness is that I think this class didn’t go into detail about how program works, or how computer process the program.

You get into the nitty gritty of Java and learn how to become an efficient coder.  It makes learning other coding languages easier and installs good coding habits.  The cons.  This class is very time consuming.  You will spend upwards of 20 hours a week on projects.  But all this extra time coding makes you a very good programmer.  Overall I enjoyed this class a lot and would take it again.",

At the beginning of each class, the professor would ask the class if we had any questions on the material we learned at home and would briefly go over it making sure we fully understood. It was also nice being able to work on problems in class so the professor is right there when we need help.\n\nA weakness is I think ICS 211 courses should take a little more time on the more complicated sort methods and data structures. I kind of felt we took a long time on easy methods like bubble sorts and insertion sort, but once we hit merge sort, recursion, queues, etc. the lessons went by so quick I wasn't able to feel like I fully perfected these before moving onto the next topic. I advice students to make sure to keep up with the material and never start on your projects on the day of. Also, I advice them to stay in class during the practice problems to get the extra help.",

He is really fun guy to be with. The funniest he ever said is after we learn all these things, he said that, \" Do not implement your own code and just use the one provided by the language you use if there is one\". I do recommend taking his class for the future students. The only thing is that he made this class way more easy, guarantee an A for his class if you did do some work.",

Learning about all the different types of Abstract Data Types(ADTs) and methods seem pointless, but you will be surprised how easy they make your life.\nA weakness to ICS 211 is that you are constantly learning a new ADT 1-2 weeks. It may seem like a lot of time, but it really isn't. Trying to do the homework without knowing how the ADT works is borderline impossible.\nMy advice to future students is that you should try to start on the homework 3-5 days before its due. You don't actually have to work on, but just try to start it. This is so when you are doing other things and have free time, just think/brainstorm your program. A lot of times, if you can draw out your code then like write a general summary of the process of what has to happen. It makes writing the actual code a lot easier.",

Baek was my professor that semester I took it, and she is very efficient in teaching and obviously passionate, though, she can be quiet at times. Overall she is a great professor who will answer your questions very well. Test and final are fair, and tend to be as difficult as the homework given. The true test is being able to apply all of the skills learned without any reference material. And be warned, the tests do cover a lot of material. The TA of the class does sample problems from homework in recitation periods, which is also very helpful so be sure to attend those whenever possible. Assuming you have taken 141 here at UHM, you should come to realize that the content covered in this class is slightly easier.

These lectures were clear and very useful.  However, I did not find the activities and problems done in class very helpful.  Quizzes given every class were difficult and since it was graded by fellow classmates, the grading was very inconsistent.  We also created our own quizzes, called flip-flop quizzes, which we made for other classmates to take.  These quizzes were a waste of time and most students just created them to fulfill the assignment, rather than create quality challenging questions.  One positive thing about the class was the help of the TA.  I would go to office hours every week to get extra help on the homework or class problems, which was extremely helpful.

My biggest problem with the class was the online quizzes. The instructor had students create quizzes on his website, but I found that this was not a helpful tool for learning. Many students did not complete their quizzes and there was not a clear outline for how these quizzes would be scored. The syllabus stated that the online quizzes would be worth 11% of our total grade, but throughout the semester points for the online quizzes were never posted nor did we get any feedback on them from the instructor.

This class builds off of the discrete math foundation formed in 141 and 241 to delve into algorithmic theory. So be sure you know that you understand time complexity and how to express programs in pseudocode. One of the things to note of this class is its inverted structure. You use the given resources and the CLSR Algorithms text book to learn yourself the chapter outside of class. In class, you will then take a quiz to test your knowledge and then split into groups to solve problems pertaining to what you have learned. This can be a good or a bad thing for a student. On one hand, class time is devoted to practice and you have the professor (in my case Nodari) to track how you are doing in person. On the other, those who do not have a lot of out-of-class time will not be able to grasp the material as well as those who do. It really depends on your situation. \nHomework in this class is very difficult. You have a week to complete a set of 3 to 5 problems. Do not be fooled by the amount of problems, because each homework assignment takes at least 5-6 hours to complete.

Much of my grade came from the final project. There I had the chance to show off my programming prowess by designing a database and applying what I learned. I hadn't created a website before, but I learned! I created a simple website with a backend MySQL database.",

Although it was easy to get a good grade (depending on the instructor), I felt like I needed to motivate myself in order to grasp a good understanding of databases, MySQL, JavaScript, etc. I thought the final project was the best aspect of this course because it is something that can be used for your online portfolio if it is well done. For any future students that take this course, I highly encourage them to attend office hours and ask questions because it's easy to get lost on some of the material.",

          "comments": "ICS 321 focuses on databases. The final project in this course was a great strength in this course because it allows students to use what they have learned from other classes and outside resources to create an amazing application that uses a SQL database. Being able to create a database-backed application is very important because it allows students to get a sense of what \"real\" programming and software development is like which makes this final project extremely relevant to the real world. One weakness I found in the course is that the majority of the course focuses on things like Normal Forms and Triggers and other theories of DBMS. Theory is extremely important when it comes to research and I feel like understanding them would greatly benefit me as a Computer Scientist; however, I had a difficult time understanding how to use what I learned from them in a real life situation. Therefore, I felt that I would have benefitted more from this course if we worked more on manipulating a database as opposed to only having only one assignment on SQL. My advice for future students is that they should take this class and see it through the very end because the final project is really useful and a great way to build their professional portfolio. Learning how to integrate databases with an application is important for any software engineer or software developer to know.",

The material was super cool and important as it focused on real life examples on the importance of using databases. The abstract concepts were translated into tangible material. Also, the tests reflected this and covered the homework assignments rather than theories. For some, a weakness of the class was the professor as he was not very strict on due dates. The reason for this, as he put it this way, was \"Ultimately, I want my students to learn, not be put off by due dates.\"",

It is an important concept to learn if you are planning to host and store user or personal data for a website or app as you can have a better understanding as to how your information is store away. If I had to give a weakness to this class it would be that during the final project where we create our own simple database, I often see other students be proficient in not only making a functioning database, but they also had the knowledge to create a proper website front for their project. For this class specifically we are not taught how to create a website so for people who do not have any knowledge, looking at other people's projects could make yours feel a bit inadequate sometimes. But don't worry, as long as the database itself is working properly you still get the A. My advice would be to just start your assignments early and maybe look up how to make a website to have a nicer final project.",

All of the projects in the class were designed to mimic real life implementations and the final project was a theme of choice web app. However most of the assignments that required programming, required knowledge of html and php, which was only covered slightly in class. This may be a turn off and a difficulty for most students who do not have this kind of experience. As one of those students, however, I did end up getting an A. Halverson, a the professor of the class at the time I took it, is very straight forward and records lectures for convenience, which I really appreciated.

This is a great language to learn since it is the most common programming language used to manipulate or manage a database.  Knowing SQL can be a useful skill since it is sought after by employers in positions and fields that are not strictly ICS related.  For example, any business that uses a database to function requires it, including retailers, hospitals, banks, et cetera. With that said, I highly recommend taking this course to learn this invaluable language.\n\nDr. Halverson is the professor who has been teaching this course these past spring semesters, and the previous summer semester, and I personally took this course from him.  One nice thing about taking this course from him is that he records his in-class lectures.  Bear in mind that the purpose of this is not to encourage students to get lazy and not attend his class.  I would not recommend this since there are times when his recordings do not cover solutions that he explains exclusively to those who attend his class.  Instead, the advantage of having these recordings available will allow one to rewatch the lecture in case he or she gets stuck and has a \"How do I do this again?\" moment.  Dr. Halverson is also quite responsive and flexible, so if you decide to take this course, I would recommend taking it from him.",

The assignments are very interesting because you get to mess around with a program that allows you to make and manipulate a virtual circuit. The downside is unless you plan on working with low level language code, the material you learn in this class may be irrelevant to what you will do in the future. That being said, I did enjoy the class and the assignments, and I advise that you should take the time to learn about binary and hex coding anyway.",
