This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more semesters where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](../courses/ics499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

Such networks could range from simple connections between a set of offices to large-scale cloud infrastructures serving millions of people. \n\nConsider this career goal if you are comfortable and interested in work that combines design and decision-making about both software and hardware.

In RadGrad, the research scientist career goal represents job positions that typically require a Ph.D., such as \"Professor\" (in academia) or \"Research Scientist\" (in industry).  \n\nResearch scientists design, implement, and evaluate new approaches to computing and computing technology, and apply those approaches to solving significant problems in business, medicine, science, and other fields. Research scientists have the highest level of autonomy of any career goal; you are hired by an organization with the expectation that you will define and organize your work yourself (while within the general business or academic constraints of the organization).  Research scientists can often wear jeans and a t-shirt to work, because you will be evaluated almost totally on your ability to innovate. \n\nTo prepare to become a research scientist, you should also have [graduate school](graduate-school) as a career goal, and you should plan to (eventually) get a Ph.D. That said, you don't have to go to graduate school immediately: you might decide after graduation to first join or create a startup company based upon an idea you had as an undergraduate.  Successful research scientists have a tolerance for risk: not all research ideas are successful (if you can guarantee in advance that an idea will be successful, then by definition it no longer involves research).\n\nIf this career goal appeals to you, get involved with one (or more) research projects as an undergraduate.  This will both give you a taste for the work and enable you to develop connections with professors that will help when you eventually apply to graduate school.  If possible, try to publish a paper while you are an undergraduate. Your professor can help you to make that happen.

This career goal also includes position titles such as Developer, Software Engineer, Programmer, Coder, Software Architect, Business Application Programmer, Programmer Analyst, and so forth.  \n\nBecause of their popularity and because they require specialized software development skills, RadGrad also defines more specialized career goals that are related to Software Developer: [Mobile App Developer](mobile-app-developer), [Game Developer](game-developer), and [Full Stack Developer](full-stack-developer). If you're not sure what kind of development you want to do, then Software Developer is a good bet.\n\nIn general, software developers are responsible for designing computing programs, applications, and support systems. They meet with clients to discuss technological needs, and then develop software to addresses those demands.  Once initially implemented, software developers must modify and maintain the systems as business requirements for the software change.\n\nTo prepare for the software developer, you need strong programming and software engineering skills which is guaranteed by any of the ICS degree programs.  Beyond the classroom, you should participate in programming-related events like coding competitions and hackathons.  You should also consider a summer internship doing software development for a business in order to gain \"real-world\" experience prior to graduation.\n\nSoftware Engineer was named [one of the 14 best tech jobs in America](http://www.cio.com/article/3167568/it-skills-training/14-best-tech-jobs-in-america.html#slide9).

Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.

On June 29, 2010, United States House legislature passed recognizing the National CCDC for promoting cyber security curriculum.\n\nWhile similar to other cyber defense competitions in many aspects, the NCCDC, is unique in that it focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing network infrastructure. While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing commercial network. Teams are assessed based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.

But rather than the traditional around-the-clock development over a single day or weekend, HACC will offer an extended period for development over one month.\n\nThe kickoff event will include team formation, foundational training, and workshops. In addition, participants will select from a list of challenges themed around key problems facing the state, and then work over the next several weeks to develop their solutions. The expanded month-long timeframe is meant to encourage sustainable solutions that are appropriately matched with technologies and platforms in use or being considered by the state.

We'll explore how technology can help support activism and where activism can push it forward.\n\nhnltech4good is sponsored by TechSoup's NetSquared Local. Join us!

Topics include circuitry, computer hardware and software, Minecraft ahupuaʻa, and modding. This year we’re also running a series of traveling workshops teaching javascript and xcode in different communities around Oʻahu and exposing more students to coding.\n\nWe target middle school kids because they’re at an age where they’re open and ready for learning coding basics, but we will eventually provide edtech opportunities throughout the course of education. The metaphor we use is the idea of a tech ʻauwai–a channel of tech knowledge that kids can flow along through school, interacting with and enriching their communities along the way.

SARP participants will assist in the operation of instruments onboard an aircraft to sample atmospheric chemicals, and/or to image land and water surfaces in multiple spectral bands.\n\nResearch areas include atmospheric chemistry, air quality, forest ecology, and ocean biology. Along with airborne data collection, students will participate in taking measurements at field sites. The program culminates with formal presentations of research results and conclusions.

Thus, pilots could suicide the aircraft, the auto-pilot might be infected by malware, and air traffic controllers can mishandle the drone. To better mitigate the potential risks, we hope to propose theoretical framework model in physical, human and cyber triad, a more secure air traffic control system, and a more safe task allocation mechanism.
