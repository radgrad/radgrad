This doesn't mean you need to go right back to school after you graduate; many if not most graduate students in computer science spent at least a few years working before returning to school. But obtaining an M.S. or Ph.D. in Computer Science at some point can open up many new opportunities in your professional career. \n\nThe basic difference between an M.S. and Ph.D. degree is \"scientific contribution\".  An M.S. degree enables you to obtain more advanced skills in any of the CS disciplines.  M.S. programs are typically two years long.  A Ph.D. degree adds the requirement that you develop a dissertation that documents a scientific contribution: some entirely new knowledge about computer science. The Ph.D. degree typically requires at least two to four additional years after the M.S. degree.  \n\nTo prepare to include graduate school at some point after you graduate, the most important thing to do is to plan one or more semesters where you participate in a research project with a professor.  You can do this via [ICS 499](../courses/ics499), or even on a volunteer basis as long as you devote sufficient time to the project. This is important for two reasons. First, successful participation demonstrates to the people who later review your graduate school application that you are able to do graduate-level work, which is usually more independent and research-related.  Second, it enables your professor to get to know you on a more personal level and in the context of an independent project, not just a few homework assignments.  This will enable your professor to write you a strong recommendation letter, which is crucial to getting accepted to graduate school.

A startup is usually a company such as a small business, a partnership or an organization designed to rapidly develop a scalable business model.*\n\nIf your career goal is to start a new high tech business, then you will want a solid foundation in computer science, but the specific courses depend upon the application domain.  You might want to combine this career goal with another, more application-specific goal, such as [game developer](game-developer) or [VR/AR Engineer](vr-ar-engineer). \n\nRegardless of the application domain, you will want to acquire an understanding of business issues in general and startup issues in particular. You will definitely want to participate in the [Shidler Business Plan Competition](../opportunities/shider-bpc), and you might also want to do one or more summer internships to get a better sense of how technology development is shaped by market and organizational forces.
