If you're a self-starting hands-on type, you may do just as well on the job. If you like working on really hard problems, well before the productization phase, you should consider getting a Ph.D. With a Ph.D. you can work in a corporate or government research lab, become a college professor, or become a university professor. The hours are long and the uncharted territory can be frustrating, but you won't really notice if you enjoy it. The pay is pretty good, if you ignore the fact that you're not working a 40 hour work week.",

Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well-defined successive states, eventually producing \"output\" and terminating at a final ending state. The transition from one state to the next is not necessarily deterministic; some algorithms, known as randomized algorithms, incorporate random input.",

          "description": "HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) simulates the conditions of long-duration human space exploration. Due to the distance between Earth and Mars, it takes 4-24 minutes for a signal to get from one to the other. However, most communication software is designed for much lower latency. For this project, you will design and implement a communications/social-media app that can handle high latency gracefully.",

While other exercises examine the abilities of a group of students to design, configure, and protect a network over the course of an entire semester, this competition is focused on the more operational task of assuming administrative and protective duties for an existing commercial network. Teams are assessed based on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services such as mail servers and web servers, respond to business requests such as the addition or removal of additional services, and balance security needs against business needs.",

But rather than the traditional around-the-clock development over a single day or weekend, HACC will offer an extended period for development over one month.\n\nThe kickoff event will include team formation, foundational training, and workshops. In addition, participants will select from a list of challenges themed around key problems facing the state, and then work over the next several weeks to develop their solutions. The expanded month-long timeframe is meant to encourage sustainable solutions that are appropriately matched with technologies and platforms in use or being considered by the state.",

Topics include circuitry, computer hardware and software, Minecraft ahupuaʻa, and modding. This year we’re also running a series of traveling workshops teaching javascript and xcode in different communities around Oʻahu and exposing more students to coding.\n\nWe target middle school kids because they’re at an age where they’re open and ready for learning coding basics, but we will eventually provide edtech opportunities throughout the course of education. The metaphor we use is the idea of a tech ʻauwai–a channel of tech knowledge that kids can flow along through school, interacting with and enriching their communities along the way.",

SARP participants will assist in the operation of instruments onboard an aircraft to sample atmospheric chemicals, and/or to image land and water surfaces in multiple spectral bands.\n\nResearch areas include atmospheric chemistry, air quality, forest ecology, and ocean biology. Along with airborne data collection, students will participate in taking measurements at field sites. The program culminates with formal presentations of research results and conclusions.",

The projects weren't hard for beginner programmers and were interesting to get them to have more fun with programming. The only downside was that the class didn't fully prepare you for ICS 211 where the fun little projects became assignments focused on the next stage of programming. There isn't much new students can do in terms of preparing for ICS 211 from ICS 111 since it is based on what you learn, but the things that you do learn may prove useful.",
