# IDE Setup

For RadGrad development, we recommend [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).  IntelliJ IDEA has excellent support for Meteor application development. 

To configure IntelliJ for RadGrad development, you may want to follow the [ICS 314 instructions](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/development-environments/experience-install-intellij-idea.html).

The [ics-se-code-style](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/development-environments/ics-se-code-style.xml) file configures IntelliJ with the coding style checked by ESLint.
